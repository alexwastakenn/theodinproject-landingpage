# Landing Page

Working on this project was actually quite stressful so I took lots of time off to clear my mind.
I guess the stylesheet could be optimized but that's work for another time.
In this project I wanted to use some more git features like:
conventional git messages, protected main branch, more & frequent commits,
developing on different branch. I overall liked the workflow but the frequent commits sometimes
made working tedious over long periods.

With this project & especially towards the end I managed to grasp the basics of CSS Flexbox.
Even though my code could be very well optimized and be more clean I'm actually very happy
with the outcome and I'm happy I persevered.
